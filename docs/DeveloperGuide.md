## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

The following provides a quick overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* provides its functionality through a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class that implements the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`. Other components interact with a component through its interface rather than its concrete class, preventing them from coupling to that component's implementation, as illustrated in the following partial class diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and its parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures common behavior among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in `src/main/resources/view`. For example, [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) specifies the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component because it displays `Person` objects from the model.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `find` command filters contacts by name keywords.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command" />

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to a `CommandInputParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, the code can require several interactions between the command object and the `Model` to complete the operation.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CommandInputParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`). The parser uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`). The `CommandInputParser` returns that object as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes, such as `AddCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`, implement the `Parser` interface so they can be treated similarly where appropriate, for example during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

`Status.DEFAULT` is `PROSPECT`. Each `Person` stores one status, optionally one follow-up date, optionally one last-contact date, and zero or more interaction notes.
`Name` starts with a Unicode letter, ends with a letter or decimal digit (possibly carrying combining marks), and accepts common name punctuation
between characters, up to 1000 input characters; `Phone` accepts
an optional leading plus sign and separators between at least three digits.
`Phone` is capped at 30 characters and `Email` at 254. Both lengths are checked before the regex, so
a very long value from a command or the data file is rejected instead of overflowing the stack.


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the `Person` objects selected by the current filter, such as search results, in a separate _filtered_ list. It exposes this list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that the UI can observe and bind to, so the UI updates when the list changes.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user's preferences (currently, just the GUI settings). This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The alternative, arguably more object-oriented, design below keeps a unique list of tags in `AddressBook`, and each `Person` references tags from that list. This lets `AddressBook` maintain one `Tag` object per unique tag instead of each `Person` holding its own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />
</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both contact data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates the actual JSON file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (one class per data file).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### Loading and backing up the data file

Contact data is stored in `data/addressbook.json`, in the folder the app is launched from. `MainApp#initModelManager`
reads it once at startup by calling `Storage#readAddressBookWithBackup()`, which `StorageManager` passes on to
`JsonAddressBookStorage`. The activity diagram below shows the possible outcomes.

<puml src="diagrams/DataFileLoadingActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Loading the data file at startup" />

1. If the data file does not exist, `JsonUtil.readJsonFile` returns `Optional.empty()` and `MainApp` loads the
   sample contacts from `SampleDataUtil`. The file is created the first time a command changes contact data.
2. Otherwise, `FileUtil.readFromFile` reads the bytes and decodes them as UTF-8 with a decoder that reports invalid
   bytes instead of replacing them with the character U+FFFD. Replaced characters would be written back on the next
   save, so the original text would be lost. The error gives the byte offset of the first invalid sequence.
3. `JsonUtil.fromJsonString` parses the text in three steps:
   * `requireValidStructure` reads the tokens without recursion. It rejects a key that appears twice in one object,
     and objects or arrays nested more than 100 levels deep (`MAX_NESTING_DEPTH`), giving the line and column.
     Without this pass, a repeated key would be reported without its location, and deep nesting would overflow
     the stack inside Jackson.
   * Jackson maps the JSON value to a `JsonSerializableAddressBook`. Unknown fields are ignored.
   * `requireNoTrailingContent` rejects anything other than whitespace after the JSON value, because Jackson stops
     reading after the first value and would drop the rest without an error.

   `readJsonFile` also rejects a file that contains only `null`.
4. `JsonSerializableAddressBook#toModelType` converts each `JsonAdaptedPerson`, which checks every field with the
   same model methods that the commands use, such as `Name#isValidName`. Null entries and duplicate contacts are
   rejected. A missing or blank `status` becomes `PROSPECT` and a missing `followUp` means no follow-up, so data
   files from older versions still load.
5. A failure in any of steps 2 to 4 causes a `DataLoadingException`. `readAddressBookWithBackup` copies the data
   file to `addressbook.json.bak` in the same folder, replacing any older backup, and rethrows the exception.
   `MainApp` logs a warning and starts with an empty `AddressBook`.
6. If the data file is not a regular file, such as a folder, or the copy cannot be made, `readAddressBookWithBackup`
   throws a `DataBackupException` instead. `MainApp#initModelManager` rethrows it as an `IllegalStateException`, so
   the app does not open. The message names the data file and the backup path and says that the original file was
   not changed.

Starting with an empty list does not save anything. The invalid data file stays on disk until the first command
that changes contact data replaces it, because `LogicManager` skips saving when the data is unchanged.
From then on, the `.bak` copy is the only copy of the old data.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: What to do when the data file cannot be loaded**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Back up the file, then start with an empty contact list.
  * Pros: The app opens whenever the invalid file can be backed up, and the user's data is kept in full in the
    `.bak` file for recovery.
  * Cons: The next change replaces the invalid file, so the user must recover from the `.bak` file. A later
    failed load replaces that backup too.
* **Alternative 2:** Refuse to start until the file is fixed.
  * Pros: The invalid file can never be overwritten.
  * Cons: The agent cannot use the app at all until they find and fix the problem in the JSON by hand. We keep
    this behaviour only for the case where the backup cannot be made, because starting then would put the only
    copy of the data at risk.

**Aspect: How strictly to read the file**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reject invalid UTF-8, repeated keys, deep nesting, trailing content and
  invalid field values. Accept unknown fields and missing optional fields.
  * Pros: No contact data is dropped or changed without the user knowing (only unknown fields, which the app does
    not use, are discarded on the next save), and a rejected file is backed up whole. Files from older versions
    still load.
  * Cons: One bad value makes the whole file load as an empty list, instead of skipping only the bad contact.
* **Alternative 2:** Read leniently, for example by skipping invalid contacts, keeping the last of repeated keys
  and replacing bad bytes.
  * Pros: More of the data appears straight away.
  * Cons: The skipped contacts and replaced text are lost for good on the next save, with no backup and no
    warning, so the user may not notice until much later.

### Completing a follow-up

The `done INDEX` command clears the pending follow-up of the contact at the specified index in the currently
displayed list. It preserves the contact's name, phone, email, address, status and tags.

The sequence diagram below shows a successful `done 1` command when the first displayed contact has a pending
follow-up. Individual field getters and the internal calls within `Model` and `Storage` are omitted for clarity.

<puml src="diagrams/DoneSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Completing a pending follow-up" />

1. `LogicManager` passes the command text to `CommandInputParser`, which creates a `DoneCommandParser`.
2. `DoneCommandParser` validates the argument using `ParserUtil.parseIndex` and creates a `DoneCommand` with
   the resulting index. The command is returned to `LogicManager` for execution.
3. Before execution, `LogicManager` copies the address book and remembers the current list filter and sort order.
   `DoneCommand` obtains the currently displayed contacts from `Model`, checks the index and selects the
   contact. It then checks that the selected contact has a pending follow-up.
4. The command constructs a replacement `Person`, copying the other contact details and setting the
   follow-up to `Optional.empty()`. It calls `Model.setPerson` to replace the original contact in memory.
5. The command returns a `CommandResult` containing `Marked follow-up for <name> as completed.`.
   `LogicManager` obtains the updated address book from `Model` and passes it to `Storage.saveAddressBook`.
   After the save succeeds, `LogicManager` returns the result to its caller.

`DoneCommand` interacts with the `Model` interface to update the contact. `LogicManager` coordinates saving
through the `Storage` interface; the model does not call storage directly.

#### Unsuccessful outcomes

* An invalid index argument, such as a missing, zero, negative or non-numeric index, causes a `ParseException`.
* A positive index outside the currently displayed list causes a `CommandException`.
* A contact without a pending follow-up causes a `CommandException` with the message
  `<name> does not have a pending follow-up.`.

These validation failures leave the contact unchanged. Execution stops before `Model.setPerson` and
`Storage.saveAddressBook` are called.

If saving fails with an `IOException` (including `AccessDeniedException`), `LogicManager` restores the
pre-command address book, filter and sort order, then throws a `CommandException` with a save-error message.
Permission errors name the configured data file rather than an internal temporary file. If a file blocks a
required parent folder, the error names both the data file and the blocking path.
The restored contact still has its pending follow-up, and the displayed indexes return to their previous order.
No success result is returned. This rollback applies to commands that change contact data, including
interaction notes. `LogicManager` compares the address book before and after execution and skips saving
when the data is unchanged. Read-only commands such as `list`, `find`, `due`, `history`, `help` and `exit`
therefore still work when the data file cannot be written, and their view changes are retained.

`JsonAddressBookStorage` writes the complete replacement JSON to a temporary file in the destination's
directory, then atomically replaces the destination. A failed write or replacement leaves the previous JSON
intact. It deletes the temporary file on failure; if cleanup also fails, that exception is retained with the
original failure for diagnosis. If the file system does not support atomic replacement, saving fails safely
instead of falling back to an operation that could damage the existing file.

Future undo integration must record a change only after saving succeeds. A failed undo save must restore the
data and view from before that attempt and retain the undo entry for retry. The current rollback tests verify
that interaction note text, order and timestamps are preserved. Last-contact dates and undo are not part
of the current implementation; their preservation tests must be added when those features merge.

### Viewing due follow-ups

`due [DAYS]` shows contacts whose follow-up date is on or before today plus `DAYS`, earliest first.

* `DueCommandParser` accepts no argument (0 days) or a whole number from 0 to 365, so the cutoff date can never overflow.
* `DueCommand` works out the cutoff from a `Clock`. The app passes the system clock, and tests pass a fixed one, so the tests do not depend on the real date.
* `FollowUpDueByPredicate` keeps contacts that have a follow-up on or before the cutoff. Contacts without a follow-up are left out.
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate, Comparator)` filters and sorts the displayed list in one step. `ModelManager` wraps its `FilteredList` in a `SortedList`, and `getFilteredPersonList()` returns the sorted view, so index-based commands such as `done 1` act on the order the user sees.
* The one-argument `updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate)` clears the comparator, so `list` and `find` replace the current view and return to stored order. Adding or editing a contact retains the active filter and sort order; the displayed list updates as contacts change.

The sequence diagram below shows how `due 7` is executed.

<puml src="diagrams/DueSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic and Model components for the `due 7` command" />

**Design considerations:**

* **Sorting the displayed list (current choice):** the stored order is unchanged and only the view is sorted, so the data file stays the same and `list` restores the usual order.
* **Sorting the stored contacts (alternative):** simpler to display, but it would permanently reorder the data file every time `due` is run.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* junior insurance agent who is building their own base of prospects and clients
* has a growing number of prospects and clients, and struggles to remember who to follow up with and when
* currently keeps prospects scattered across phone contacts, chat apps and spreadsheets
* works alone on their own laptop and prefers desktop apps
* can type fast and prefers typing and keyboard shortcuts to mouse interactions
* is new to CLI apps, but willing to learn a few short commands

**Value proposition**: Keep track of prospects and clients, what status each one has, and when to follow up next, faster than juggling phone contacts, chat apps and spreadsheets.

Easy-Insurance focuses on managing prospects and clients. It does not send messages or make calls, generate quotations or premiums, recommend policies, manage claims, track commissions, or replace the agency's official CRM. It is a single-user app, so nothing is shared with other agents.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is Easy-Insurance and the **Actor** is the insurance agent.)

**Use case: Add a prospect and plan a follow-up**

**MSS**

1. Agent provides the new prospect's name and contact details.
2. System validates the details and saves the contact with status `PROSPECT`.
3. System confirms the new prospect. If the current view filters it out, the agent can run `list` to show it.
4. Agent sets a follow-up date for the prospect.
5. System saves the pending follow-up and shows its date with the prospect.

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The contact details are invalid or incomplete.
  * 2a1. System explains which details need correction without changing saved contact data.
  * 2a2. Agent corrects the details.
  * Use case resumes at step 2.
* 2b. A contact with the same name already exists, ignoring case and extra spaces.
  * 2b1. System explains that the contact already exists without changing saved contact data.
  * Use case ends.
* 4a. The follow-up date is invalid.

2. System ignores leading and trailing spaces and checks that the search value is present.
   A phone search must contain digits only.
3. For a name search, the system matches the start of any word in a contact's name against any supplied keyword,
   ignoring case. For example, `find ta` matches `John Tan`.
   For a phone search, it looks for the supplied consecutive digits in the phone number, ignoring stored formatting
   such as spaces and dashes.
4. System shows only matching contacts and reports how many were found.

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. No name keyword was supplied.
  * 2a1. System shows `Please enter at least one name keyword to search for. Example: find alice tan`.

  * Use case ends.
* 3b. The follow-up date is in the past.
  * 3b1. System saves the date and warns the agent that it is in the past.
  * Use case resumes at step 4.
* 4a. The selected contact is not in the displayed list.
  * 4a1. System explains that the contact reference is invalid.

3. System shows only the contacts whose follow-up date is on or before the cutoff date, including overdue ones,
   earliest date first. Contacts with the same date are sorted by name.
4. System reports how many follow-ups are due and the cutoff date.

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 1a. Agent does not give a number of days.
  * 1a1. System uses 0 days, so the cutoff date is today.
  * Use case resumes at step 3.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index does not refer to a shown contact.
  * 3a1. System explains that the index is invalid and changes nothing.

    Use case resumes at step 2.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Easy-Insurance should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Java `25` or above installed.
2. With up to 1000 contacts, listing and finding contacts should complete within two seconds on a typical laptop.
3. An agent should be able to add, find, edit, and view contacts and manage follow-ups using the keyboard alone.
4. The app should work without an internet connection and should not transmit contact details to a network service.
5. An agent who knows the commands should be able to complete common contact tasks faster by typing than by using the mouse.
6. Contact data should be stored locally as human-editable JSON.
7. The app should be distributed as a single JAR of at most 100 MB, with no installer required.

### Glossary

* **Contact**: A person recorded in Easy-Insurance, together with their contact details, status, and any follow-up.
* **Status**: Where a contact is in the agent's pipeline: `PROSPECT`, `CLIENT` or `INACTIVE`. New contacts are prospects unless told otherwise.
* **Prospect**: A contact the agent may sell a policy to but who is not yet a client.
* **Client**: A contact who has bought a policy from the agent.
* **Inactive**: A contact the agent is no longer actively pursuing but keeps in the app.
* **Follow-up**: The date on which the agent intends to next contact a prospect or client. A past date is accepted with a warning and is treated as an overdue follow-up until it is marked done.
* **Pending follow-up**: A follow-up date that is still recorded on a contact. Marking it done removes the date.
* **Duplicate contact**: A contact whose name matches an existing contact's name after ignoring letter case and extra spaces. Easy-Insurance refuses to add a duplicate.
* **Index**: The number shown next to a contact in the currently displayed list. Commands such as `edit`, `delete` and `done` refer to contacts by index.
* **Name keyword**: Non-empty text used by `find` to match the start of any word in a contact's name, ignoring letter case.
* **Phone search digits**: A non-empty sequence of digits used by `find p/PHONE_DIGITS` to match consecutive digits in a phone number, ignoring stored formatting.
* **Tag**: A short label made of letters and digits, such as `referral`, that the agent attaches to a contact. A contact can have any number of tags.
* **Card**: The box in the contact list that shows one contact's details, including its status and follow-up date.
* **CLI**: Command line interface. The agent types commands into the command box instead of clicking buttons.

testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.
</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download `EasyInsurance.jar` and copy it into an empty folder.

   1. Open a terminal in that folder and run `java -jar EasyInsurance.jar`.<br>
      Expected: The window titled Easy-Insurance opens with a set of sample contacts, each showing a status badge.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimal size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Relaunch the app the same way.<br>
      Expected: The most recent window size and location are retained.

### Listing contacts with filters

1. Preparing test contacts

   1. Prerequisites: Use disposable test data and start with an empty contact list.

   1. Add these four contacts:

      `add n/Filter Client Referral p/91110001 e/one@example.com a/1 Test Road st/CLIENT t/ReFeRRaL`

      `add n/Filter Client Family p/91110002 e/two@example.com a/2 Test Road st/CLIENT t/family`

      `add n/Filter Prospect Referral p/91110003 e/three@example.com a/3 Test Road st/PROSPECT t/referral`

      `add n/Filter Inactive p/91110004 e/four@example.com a/4 Test Road st/INACTIVE`

1. Filtering by status

   1. Test case: `list st/CLIENT`<br>
      Expected: Only Filter Client Referral and Filter Client Family are shown.
      The result is `Listed 2 contacts with status CLIENT.`

1. Filtering by tag

   1. Test case: `list t/REFERRAL`<br>
      Expected: Only Filter Client Referral and Filter Prospect Referral are shown.
      The result is `Listed 2 contacts with tag REFERRAL.`

   1. Test case: `list t/ref`<br>
      Expected: No contacts are shown.
      The result is `Listed 0 contacts with tag ref.`

1. Combining filters

   1. Test case: `list st/client t/referral`<br>
      Expected: Only Filter Client Referral is shown.
      The result is `Listed 1 contact with status CLIENT and tag referral.`

   1. Test case: `list t/REFERRAL st/CLIENT`<br>
      Expected: The same contact is shown.
      The result is `Listed 1 contact with status CLIENT and tag REFERRAL.`

1. Resetting the filter

   1. Test case: `list`<br>
      Expected: All four contacts are shown.
      The result is `Listed all contacts.`

1. Adding and editing while a filter is active

   1. Prerequisites: Run `list st/CLIENT` with the four test contacts above.<br>
      Expected: Only the two clients are shown.

   1. Test case: `add n/Hidden Prospect p/91110005 e/five@example.com a/5 Test Road st/PROSPECT`<br>
      Expected: The contact is saved but remains hidden. The result explains that the current view hides it and suggests `list` to show all contacts.

   1. Test case: `add n/Visible Client p/91110006 e/six@example.com a/6 Test Road st/CLIENT`<br>
      Expected: The new client appears in the filtered list without a hidden-contact note.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 st/PROSPECT`<br>
      Expected: The edited contact leaves the filtered list. The other clients remain visible.

1. Rejecting invalid filters

   1. Test cases: `list st/LEAD` and `list st/`<br>
      Expected: The status constraint message is shown.

   1. Test cases: `list t/` and `list t/referral!`<br>
      Expected: The tag constraint message is shown.

   1. Test cases: `list st/CLIENT st/PROSPECT` and `list t/referral t/family`<br>
      Expected: An error identifies the repeated filter prefix.

   1. Test cases: `list extra`, `list extra st/CLIENT` and `list st/CLIENT extra`<br>
      Expected: An error is shown and the current displayed list is unchanged.

### Deleting a contact

1. Deleting a contact while all contacts are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all contacts using the `list` command, with multiple contacts in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: The first contact is removed from the list. The result shows `Deleted contact: ` followed by that contact's name.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No contact is deleted. The result shows `Index must be a positive integer.`

   1. Test case: `delete 99` (where 99 is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: No contact is deleted. The result shows `There is no contact 99. The list shows N contacts.`

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `delete 1 2`<br>
      Expected: No contact is deleted. An error explains the problem.

1. Deleting a contact from a filtered list

   1. Prerequisites: Run `find` with a keyword that matches at least one contact.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: The first contact in the filtered list is deleted, not the first contact overall.

### Adding a contact with a follow-up date

1. Adding a contact with a future follow-up date

   1. Prerequisites: Run `list` so that all contacts are shown. A filter left over from an earlier test, such as `find`, would hide the new contact.

   1. Test case: `add n/Sarah Lim p/92345678 e/sarah@example.com a/10 Tampines Street 1 f/25-12-2099`<br>
      Expected: The contact is added and the card shows `Follow-up: 25-12-2099`. No note is shown.

1. Adding a contact with a past follow-up date

   1. Test case: `add n/Ben Ong p/93456789 e/ben@example.com a/5 Bishan Road f/01-01-2020`<br>
      Expected: The contact is added. The result message ends with `Note: 01-01-2020 is in the past; it was saved anyway.`<br>
      The card shows `Follow-up: 01-01-2020 (overdue)` in red, and `due` lists the contact until its follow-up is marked done.

1. Adding a contact with an impossible or badly formatted date

   1. Test case: `add n/Ann Lee p/94567890 e/ann@example.com a/1 Clementi Ave f/31-02-2026`<br>
      Expected: No contact is added. Error: `31-02-2026 is not a real date.`

   1. Test case: `add n/Ann Lee p/94567890 e/ann@example.com a/1 Clementi Ave f/2026-12-25`<br>
      Expected: No contact is added. Error: `Follow-up date must be in DD-MM-YYYY format, e.g. 25-12-2026.`

### Editing a contact

1. Editing a contact's status and follow-up date

   1. Prerequisites: List the contacts using the `list` command and note the first contact's current details.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 st/CLIENT f/25-12-2099`<br>
      Expected: The first contact's status changes to `CLIENT`, its follow-up changes to `25-12-2099`,
      and the updated details are shown.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 f/`<br>
      Expected: The first contact's follow-up is cleared. The result includes `Follow-up: none`, and its card shows `Follow-up: None`. Other contact details remain unchanged.

   1. Test case: Repeat `edit 1 f/`.<br>
      Expected: The result still includes `Follow-up: none`. The contact remains unchanged.

1. Replacing and clearing tags

   1. Prerequisites: Run `list` and ensure at least one contact is shown.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 t/b t/a`<br>
      Expected: The first contact's tags are replaced with `a` and `b`. The result includes `Tags: [a] [b]`, and the follow-up date is unchanged.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 t/`<br>
      Expected: The tags are cleared. The result includes `Tags: none`, and the follow-up date is unchanged. Repeating the command still shows `Tags: none`.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 t/ f/`<br>
      Expected: Both tags and the follow-up are cleared. The result ends with `Tags: none; Follow-up: none`.

   1. Test case: Close and reopen the app.<br>
      Expected: The cleared fields remain empty, and the contact's other details are unchanged.

1. Editing a contact with a past follow-up date

   1. Test case: `edit 1 f/01-01-2020`<br>
      Expected: The date is saved and the result includes a warning that `01-01-2020` is in the past.

1. Invalid follow-up dates when editing

   1. Test case: `edit 1 f/31-02-2026`<br>
      Expected: No contact details change. Error: `31-02-2026 is not a real date.`

   1. Test case: `edit 1 f/2026-12-25`<br>
      Expected: No contact details change. Error: `Follow-up date must be in DD-MM-YYYY format, e.g. 25-12-2026.`

### Completing a follow-up

1. Completing a pending follow-up from a filtered list

   1. Prerequisites: Add a contact named `Followup Test` with a scheduled follow-up, for example:<br>
      `add n/Followup Test p/91234567 e/followuptest@example.com a/21 Clementi Ave 3 st/CLIENT f/25-12-2099 t/referral`<br>
      Run `find Followup` and check that only this contact is shown.

   1. Test case: `done 1`<br>
      Expected: The result shows `Marked follow-up for Followup Test as completed.`
      The card shows `Follow-up: None`. The contact's name, phone, email, address, status and tags remain unchanged.

   1. Test case: Run `done 1` again.<br>
      Expected: The result shows `Followup Test does not have a pending follow-up.` No contact details change.

   1. Test case: `done 2` while only the test contact is displayed.<br>
      Expected: The result shows `There is no contact 2. The list shows 1 contact.` No contact details change.

   1. Other incorrect commands to try: `done`, `done 0`, `done x`, `done 1 extra`<br>
      Expected: `done 0` and `done x` show `Index must be a positive integer.` Other malformed forms show the
      invalid-command-format error with `done INDEX`. No contact details change.

1. Saving a completed follow-up

   1. Prerequisites: Complete the test contact's follow-up as described above.

   1. Test case: Close the app, relaunch it, and run `find Followup`.<br>
      Expected: The contact still shows `Follow-up: None`, and all its other details remain unchanged.

### Viewing follow-ups that are due

1. Listing due follow-ups in date order

   1. Prerequisites: Add three contacts with follow-ups: one in the past, one today and one 3 days from today.
      Replace `TODAY` with today's date and `IN_3_DAYS` with the date 3 days from today, both in `DD-MM-YYYY` format.<br>
      `add n/Due Past p/91110001 e/duepast@example.com a/1 Test Road f/01-01-2020`<br>
      `add n/Due Today p/91110002 e/duetoday@example.com a/2 Test Road f/TODAY`<br>
      `add n/Due Soon p/91110003 e/duesoon@example.com a/3 Test Road f/IN_3_DAYS`

   1. Test case: `due`<br>
      Expected: `Due Past` and `Due Today` are shown in that order, plus any other contact due by today. `Due Soon` is not shown.
      The result shows `N follow-ups due by TODAY.`, where `N` is the number of contacts listed. The `Due Past` card shows its date in red with `(overdue)`.

   1. Test case: `due 3`<br>
      Expected: `Due Soon` is now included, after `Due Past` and `Due Today`. The result shows `N follow-ups due by IN_3_DAYS.`

   1. Test case: `due` followed by `done 1`<br>
      Expected: The first contact's follow-up is completed, and that contact leaves the list because it no longer has a follow-up.

   1. Other incorrect commands to try: `due -1`, `due 366`, `due abc`, `due 7 days`<br>
      Expected: No change to the list. Error: `Number of days must be a whole number from 0 to 365, e.g. due 7.`

### Saving data

1. Dealing with a missing data file

   1. Close the app. Delete `data/addressbook.json` from the folder you ran the app from.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with the sample contacts. The data file is created again after the next command that changes contact data, such as `add` or `note`. Commands that only show data, such as `list`, do not create it.

1. Dealing with a corrupted data file

   1. Prerequisites: `data/addressbook.json` exists and holds at least one contact. The previous test leaves no data file, so run `add n/Test Person p/91234567 e/test@example.com a/1 Test Road` first.

   1. Close the app. Open `data/addressbook.json` and change one contact's `"status"` value to `"lead"`.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with an empty contact list, because the file could not be read. A copy of the invalid file is saved as `data/addressbook.json.bak`. Restoring the original value and relaunching brings the contacts back.

   1. Repeat with one contact's `"phone"` changed to 31 or more digits.<br>
      Expected: The same as above. The app still opens.

1. Dealing with a data file containing JSON `null`

   1. Close the app. Replace the entire contents of `data/addressbook.json` with `null`.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with an empty contact list. Both `data/addressbook.json` and its new `.bak` copy contain exactly `null`; sample contacts do not appear.

1. Dealing with a failed backup

   1. Close the app. Put invalid JSON in `data/addressbook.json`. If `data/addressbook.json.bak` exists, move it somewhere safe, then create a non-empty folder with that name.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: Startup stops with an error naming the data and backup paths. The original `data/addressbook.json` remains unchanged.

   1. Remove the blocking folder and relaunch.<br>
      Expected: The invalid data is backed up and the app starts with an empty contact list.

1. Dealing with an older data file

   1. Prerequisites: `data/addressbook.json` holds at least one valid contact. The previous test leaves invalid data and an empty list, so run `add n/Old Format p/92345678 e/old@example.com a/2 Test Road st/CLIENT f/01-01-2030` first.

   1. Close the app. Remove the `"status"`, `"followUp"`, `"lastContact"` and `"interactionNotes"` fields from one contact in `data/addressbook.json`.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The contact loads with status `PROSPECT`, no follow-up, no last-contact date and no interaction notes. Nothing else is lost.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

The items below are known flaws in the current version. Each item describes the flaw and the exact change we plan to make in a future version.

1. **Distinguish contacts that share a name and flag likely duplicates under reordered names.**
   Uniqueness currently uses only the name, ignoring case and extra spaces. Two different people named `John Tan`
   cannot both be stored, while `Tan John` can be added as a second entry for the same person. We plan to give every
   contact a stable ID, allow the same name on different IDs, and show a confirmation when a new contact shares a
   phone number or email with an existing contact. The agent can then keep two people who share contact details or
   cancel a likely duplicate without losing either contact.

1. **Stop a second window or a hand edit of the data file from being overwritten.**
   Easy-Insurance reads `data/addressbook.json` once at startup. After that, every command that changes contact data writes the app's own copy over the file. If two windows are open on the same `data` folder, or the user edits the file while the app is running, the last save wins and the other changes are lost with no warning. For example, window 1 runs `add n/Bob Lim p/92345678 e/bob@example.com a/2 Road` and then window 2 runs `add n/Carol Ng p/93456789 e/carol@example.com a/3 Road`. Both show a success message, but after a restart Bob Lim is gone.<br>
   We plan to make the app remember a hash of the data file's contents when it loads the file and after each of its own successful saves. Before each save, it hashes the file again. If the contents have changed, the app does not save, rolls back the change in this window as it does for other save errors, and shows: `The data file was changed outside this window, so this change was not saved. Restart Easy-Insurance to load the latest data.` In the example above, window 2's `add` then shows this message and Bob Lim is kept.

1. **Reject prefixes typed in capitals instead of saving them into the previous field.**
   Prefixes are case-sensitive, so a capitalised prefix after another field is kept as part of that field's value. For example, `add n/Ann Lee p/91234567 e/ann@example.com a/1 Road ST/CLIENT F/01-01-2030` gives a result starting with `New contact added: Ann Lee (PROSPECT)`, followed by its displayed index. The address is saved as `1 Road ST/CLIENT F/01-01-2030`, and the status and follow-up are not set. `edit 1 n/Bob ST/CLIENT` renames the contact to `Bob ST/CLIENT`.<br>
   We plan to make `add` and `edit` check each value for a known prefix (`n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `st/`, `t/` or `f/`) typed with one or more capital letters after a space. If one is found, the command changes nothing and shows: `Prefixes must be typed in lowercase. Use st/ instead of ST/.` `A/L` and `A/P` inside a name stay allowed, so `add n/Ravi A/L Kumar p/92345679 e/ravi@example.com a/10 Tampines St 1` still works.

1. **Keep `a/l` and `a/p` in a name as part of the name.**
   A lowercase `a/` always starts the address, even inside a name. For example, `edit 2 n/Ravi a/l Kumar` gives `Edited contact: Ravi; ... Address: l Kumar; ...`, so the name loses `a/l Kumar` and the address is overwritten. `add n/Ravi a/l Kumar p/92345678 e/ravi@example.com a/10 Tampines St 1` fails with `Multiple values specified for the following single-valued field(s): a/`. The UG lists this as a known issue.<br>
   We plan to treat `a/` as part of the name when it comes after `n/` with no other prefix in between, and is followed by a single `l` or `p` (in either case) and then a space. The name is saved with `A/L` or `A/P` in capitals. `edit 2 n/Ravi a/l Kumar` then gives `Edited contact: Ravi A/L Kumar; ...` and leaves the address unchanged. An `a/` anywhere else still starts the address, so `edit 2 a/Lorong 1 Geylang` still sets the address.

1. **Turn a pasted tab into a space instead of deleting it.**
   The command box deletes any tab in pasted text, so a command copied from a spreadsheet or another document loses the gap between two parameters. For example, pasting `add n/Tab Test p/93456789 e/tab@example.com a/2 Road` with a tab instead of a space before `p/`, `e/` and `a/` leaves `add n/Tab Testp/93456789e/tab@example.coma/2 Road` in the command box, which gives `Missing required field(s): p/PHONE, e/EMAIL, a/ADDRESS`. Pasting `edit 1`, a tab and `p/93456780` leaves `edit 1p/93456780`, which gives `Index must be a positive integer.`<br>
   We plan to make the command box replace each pasted tab with a space. Both commands above then work the same as when they are typed with spaces.

1. **Point out a missing space after the index in `edit`.**
   `edit 4st/CLIENT` gives `Index must be a positive integer.`, although 4 is a positive integer. The real problem is the missing space before `st/`.<br>
   We plan to check whether the text in front of the first prefix is a positive integer followed directly by a known prefix. If it is, the command changes nothing and shows: `Add a space between the index and st/, e.g. edit 4 st/CLIENT.` Other invalid indexes, such as `edit abc st/CLIENT`, keep the current message.

1. **Treat an index above 2147483647 as an index outside the list.**
   An index is read as a Java `int`, so a larger number is rejected as if it were not a number at all. `delete 2147483647` gives `There is no contact 2147483647. The list shows 8 contacts.`, but `delete 99999999999` and `done 2147483648` give `Index must be a positive integer.`, which is not true.<br>
   We plan to give a positive whole number that is too large to store the same message as any other index outside the list. `delete 99999999999` then gives `There is no contact 99999999999. The list shows 8 contacts.` This applies to every command that takes an index: `delete`, `edit`, `done`, `contacted`, `note`, `history` and both indexes of `deletenote`.

1. **Accept only the digits 0 to 9 in an index.**
   Java's number parser also accepts digits from other scripts, so they work as indexes. `delete ١` (the Arabic-Indic digit one) gives `Deleted contact: John Tan`, and `edit ２ n/Bob Wide` (a full-width 2) renames the second contact. Other numbers are stricter: `due ７` is rejected with `Number of days must be a whole number from 0 to 365, e.g. due 7.`<br>
   We plan to accept an index only if every character in it is one of the digits 0 to 9. `delete ١` then gives `Index must be a positive integer.` and deletes nothing.

1. **Show the confirmation prompt when `clear` gets anything other than `confirm`.**
   `clear CONFIRM` and `clear confirm now` give `The clear command does not accept additional parameters.` This is not true, because `clear` accepts `confirm`. The message also does not say what to type.<br>
   We plan to keep `confirm` exact and lowercase, so a typo never deletes data. Any other argument changes nothing and shows the same prompt as plain `clear`, for example `This deletes all 8 contacts. Type 'clear confirm' to proceed.`

1. **Say that `find` cannot search by name and phone at the same time.**
   `find alice p/9123` and `find p/9123 alice` give `Phone search keywords must contain digits only. Example: find p/9123`, although `9123` is all digits. The real problem is that a name keyword and a phone search are mixed.<br>
   We plan to give this case its own message when there is a name keyword before `p/` or a word after the phone digits: `Search by name or by phone, not both. Use find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] or find p/PHONE_DIGITS.` A phone search with a non-digit value, such as `find p/9a23`, keeps the current message.
