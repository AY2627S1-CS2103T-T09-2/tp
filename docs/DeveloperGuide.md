## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

The following provides a quick overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* provides its functionality through a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class that implements the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`. Other components interact with a component through its interface rather than its concrete class, preventing them from coupling to that component's implementation, as illustrated in the following partial class diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and its parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures common behavior among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in `src/main/resources/view`. For example, [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) specifies the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component because it displays `Person` objects from the model.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `find` command filters contacts by name keywords.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>


How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to a `CommandInputParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, the code can require several interactions between the command object and the `Model` to complete the operation.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CommandInputParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`). The parser uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`). The `CommandInputParser` returns that object as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes, such as `AddCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`, implement the `Parser` interface so they can be treated similarly where appropriate, for example during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

`Status.DEFAULT` is `PROSPECT`. Each `Person` stores one status and optionally one follow-up date.
`Name` accepts Unicode letters and common name punctuation after an initial letter; `Phone` accepts
an optional leading plus sign and separators between at least three digits.
`Phone` is capped at 30 characters and `Email` at 254. Both lengths are checked before the regex, so
a very long value from a command or the data file is rejected instead of overflowing the stack.


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the `Person` objects selected by the current filter, such as search results, in a separate _filtered_ list. It exposes this list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that the UI can observe and bind to, so the UI updates when the list changes.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user's preferences (currently, just the GUI settings). This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The alternative, arguably more object-oriented, design below keeps a unique list of tags in `AddressBook`, and each `Person` references tags from that list. This lets `AddressBook` maintain one `Tag` object per unique tag instead of each `Person` holding its own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />
</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both contact data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates the actual JSON file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (one class per data file).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### Completing a follow-up

The `done INDEX` command clears the pending follow-up of the contact at the specified index in the currently
displayed list. It preserves the contact's name, phone, email, address, status and tags.

The sequence diagram below shows a successful `done 1` command when the first displayed contact has a pending
follow-up. Individual field getters and the internal calls within `Model` and `Storage` are omitted for clarity.

<puml src="diagrams/DoneSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Completing a pending follow-up" />

1. `LogicManager` passes the command text to `CommandInputParser`, which creates a `DoneCommandParser`.
2. `DoneCommandParser` validates the argument using `ParserUtil.parseIndex` and creates a `DoneCommand` with
   the resulting index. The command is returned to `LogicManager` for execution.
3. `DoneCommand` obtains the currently displayed contacts from `Model`, checks the index and selects the
   contact. It then checks that the selected contact has a pending follow-up.
4. The command constructs a replacement `Person`, copying the other contact details and setting the
   follow-up to `Optional.empty()`. It calls `Model.setPerson` to replace the original contact in memory.
5. The command returns a `CommandResult` containing `Marked follow-up for <name> as completed.`.
   `LogicManager` obtains the updated address book from `Model` and passes it to `Storage.saveAddressBook`.
   After the save succeeds, `LogicManager` returns the result to its caller.

`DoneCommand` interacts with the `Model` interface to update the contact. `LogicManager` coordinates saving
through the `Storage` interface; the model does not call storage directly.

#### Unsuccessful outcomes

* An invalid index argument, such as a missing, zero, negative or non-numeric index, causes a `ParseException`.
* A positive index outside the currently displayed list causes a `CommandException`.
* A contact without a pending follow-up causes a `CommandException` with the message
  `<name> does not have a pending follow-up.`.

These validation failures leave the contact unchanged. Execution stops before `Model.setPerson` and
`Storage.saveAddressBook` are called.

If saving fails with an `IOException`, `LogicManager` throws a `CommandException`.
The follow-up has already been cleared in memory and is not rolled back.
The change may not have been saved to disk.

### Viewing due follow-ups

`due [DAYS]` shows contacts whose follow-up date is on or before today plus `DAYS`, earliest first.

* `DueCommandParser` accepts no argument (0 days) or a whole number from 0 to 365, so the cutoff date can never overflow.
* `DueCommand` works out the cutoff from a `Clock`. The app passes the system clock, and tests pass a fixed one, so the tests do not depend on the real date.
* `FollowUpDueByPredicate` keeps contacts that have a follow-up on or before the cutoff. Contacts without a follow-up are left out.
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate, Comparator)` filters and sorts the displayed list in one step. `ModelManager` wraps its `FilteredList` in a `SortedList`, and `getFilteredPersonList()` returns the sorted view, so index-based commands such as `done 1` act on the order the user sees.
* The one-argument `updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate)` clears the comparator, so `list` and `find` replace the current view and return to stored order. Adding or editing a contact retains the active filter and sort order; the displayed list updates as contacts change.

The sequence diagram below shows how `due 7` is executed.

**Note:** The lifeline for `DueCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

**Design considerations:**

* **Sorting the displayed list (current choice):** the stored order is unchanged and only the view is sorted, so the data file stays the same and `list` restores the usual order.
* **Sorting the stored contacts (alternative):** simpler to display, but it would permanently reorder the data file every time `due` is run.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* junior insurance agent who is building their own base of prospects and clients
* has a growing number of prospects and clients, and struggles to remember who to follow up with and when
* currently keeps prospects scattered across phone contacts, chat apps and spreadsheets
* works alone on their own laptop and prefers desktop apps
* can type fast and prefers typing and keyboard shortcuts to mouse interactions
* is new to CLI apps, but willing to learn a few short commands

**Value proposition**: Keep track of prospects and clients, what status each one has, and when to follow up next, faster than juggling phone contacts, chat apps and spreadsheets.

Easy-Insurance focuses on managing prospects and clients. It does not send messages or make calls, generate quotations or premiums, recommend policies, manage claims, track commissions, or replace the agency's official CRM. It is a single-user app, so nothing is shared with other agents.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is Easy-Insurance and the **Actor** is the insurance agent.)

**Use case: Add a prospect and plan a follow-up**

**MSS**

1. Agent provides the new prospect's name and contact details.
2. System validates the details and saves the contact with status `PROSPECT`.
3. System shows the new prospect in the contact list.
4. Agent sets a follow-up date for the prospect.
5. System saves the pending follow-up and shows its date with the prospect.

   Use case ends.

* 2a. The contact details are invalid or incomplete.
  * 2a1. System explains which details need correction without changing saved contact data.
  * 2a2. Agent corrects the details.
  * Use case resumes at step 2.
* 2b. A contact with the same name already exists, ignoring case and extra spaces.
  * 2b1. System explains that the contact already exists without changing saved contact data.
  * Use case ends.

4. System removes the contact and confirms which contact was deleted.

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. No contacts are shown.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index does not refer to a shown contact.
  * 3a1. System explains that the index is invalid and changes nothing.

    Use case resumes at step 2.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Easy-Insurance should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Java `25` or above installed.
2. With up to 1000 contacts, listing and finding contacts should complete within two seconds on a typical laptop.
3. An agent should be able to add, find, edit, and view contacts and manage follow-ups using the keyboard alone.
4. The app should work without an internet connection and should not transmit contact details to a network service.
5. An agent who knows the commands should be able to complete common contact tasks faster by typing than by using the mouse.
6. Contact data should be stored locally as human-editable JSON.
7. The app should be distributed as a single JAR of at most 100 MB, with no installer required.

### Glossary

* **Contact**: A person recorded in Easy-Insurance, together with their contact details, status, and any follow-up.
* **Status**: Where a contact is in the agent's pipeline: `PROSPECT`, `CLIENT` or `INACTIVE`. New contacts are prospects unless told otherwise.
* **Prospect**: A contact the agent may sell a policy to but who is not yet a client.
* **Client**: A contact who has bought a policy from the agent.
* **Inactive**: A contact the agent is no longer actively pursuing but keeps in the app.
* **Follow-up**: The date on which the agent intends to next contact a prospect or client. It may be in the past, for example when recording a follow-up that already happened.
* **Pending follow-up**: A follow-up date that is still recorded on a contact. Marking it done removes the date.
* **Duplicate contact**: A contact whose name matches an existing contact's name after ignoring letter case and extra spaces. Easy-Insurance refuses to add a duplicate.
* **Index**: The number shown next to a contact in the currently displayed list. Commands such as `edit`, `delete` and `done` refer to contacts by index.
* **Name keyword**: Non-empty text used by `find` to match the start of any word in a contact's name, ignoring letter case.
* **Phone search digits**: A non-empty sequence of digits used by `find p/PHONE_DIGITS` to match consecutive digits in a phone number, ignoring stored formatting.
* **Tag**: A short label made of letters and digits, such as `referral`, that the agent attaches to a contact. A contact can have any number of tags.
* **Card**: The box in the contact list that shows one contact's details, including its status and follow-up date.
* **CLI**: Command line interface. The agent types commands into the command box instead of clicking buttons.

   1. Relaunch the app the same way.<br>
      Expected: The most recent window size and location are retained.

### Listing contacts with filters

1. Preparing test contacts

   1. Prerequisites: Use disposable test data and start with an empty contact list.

   1. Add these four contacts:

      `add n/Filter Client Referral p/91110001 e/one@example.com a/1 Test Road st/CLIENT t/ReFeRRaL`

      `add n/Filter Client Family p/91110002 e/two@example.com a/2 Test Road st/CLIENT t/family`

      `add n/Filter Prospect Referral p/91110003 e/three@example.com a/3 Test Road st/PROSPECT t/referral`

      `add n/Filter Inactive p/91110004 e/four@example.com a/4 Test Road st/INACTIVE`

1. Filtering by status

   1. Test case: `list st/CLIENT`<br>
      Expected: Only Filter Client Referral and Filter Client Family are shown.
      The result is `Listed 2 contacts with status CLIENT.`

1. Filtering by tag

   1. Test case: `list t/REFERRAL`<br>
      Expected: Only Filter Client Referral and Filter Prospect Referral are shown.
      The result is `Listed 2 contacts with tag referral.`

   1. Test case: `list t/ref`<br>
      Expected: No contacts are shown.
      The result is `Listed 0 contacts with tag ref.`

1. Combining filters

   1. Test case: `list st/client t/referral`<br>
      Expected: Only Filter Client Referral is shown.
      The result is `Listed 1 contact with status CLIENT and tag referral.`

   1. Test case: `list t/REFERRAL st/CLIENT`<br>
      Expected: The same contact and result message are shown.

1. Resetting the filter

1. Adding and editing while a filter is active

   1. Prerequisites: Run `list st/CLIENT` with the four test contacts above.<br>
      Expected: Only the two clients are shown.

   1. Test case: `add n/Hidden Prospect p/91110005 e/five@example.com a/5 Test Road st/PROSPECT`<br>
      Expected: The contact is saved but remains hidden. The result explains that the current view hides it and suggests `list` to show all contacts.

   1. Test case: `add n/Visible Client p/91110006 e/six@example.com a/6 Test Road st/CLIENT`<br>
      Expected: The new client appears in the filtered list without a hidden-contact note.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 st/PROSPECT`<br>

      Expected: No contact is deleted. The result shows `There is no contact 99. The list shows N contacts.`

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `delete 1 2`<br>
      Expected: No contact is deleted. An error explains the problem.

1. Deleting a contact from a filtered list

   1. Prerequisites: Run `find` with a keyword that matches at least one contact.

### Completing a follow-up

1. Completing a pending follow-up from a filtered list

   1. Prerequisites: Add a contact named `Followup Test` with a scheduled follow-up, for example:<br>
      `add n/Followup Test p/91234567 e/followuptest@example.com a/21 Clementi Ave 3 st/CLIENT f/25-12-2099 t/referral`<br>
      Run `find Followup` and check that only this contact is shown.

   1. Test case: `done 1`<br>
      Expected: The result shows `Marked follow-up for Followup Test as completed.`
      The card shows `Follow-up: None`. The contact's name, phone, email, address, status and tags remain unchanged.

   1. Test case: Run `done 1` again.<br>
      Expected: The result shows `Followup Test does not have a pending follow-up.` No contact details change.

   1. Test case: `done 2` while only the test contact is displayed.<br>
      Expected: The result shows `There is no contact 2. The list shows 1 contact.` No contact details change.

   1. Other incorrect commands to try: `done`, `done 0`, `done x`, `done 1 extra`<br>
      Expected: `done 0` and `done x` show `Index must be a positive integer.` Other malformed forms show the
      invalid-command-format error with `done INDEX`. No contact details change.

1. Saving a completed follow-up

   1. Prerequisites: Complete the test contact's follow-up as described above.

   1. Test case: Close the app, relaunch it, and run `find Followup`.<br>
      Expected: The contact still shows `Follow-up: None`, and all its other details remain unchanged.

### Viewing follow-ups that are due

1. Listing due follow-ups in date order

   1. Prerequisites: Add three contacts with follow-ups, one overdue, one today and one in 3 days. For example, if today is 21-10-2026:<br>
      `add n/Due Past p/91110001 e/duepast@example.com a/1 Test Road f/01-10-2026`<br>
      `add n/Due Today p/91110002 e/duetoday@example.com a/2 Test Road f/21-10-2026`<br>
      `add n/Due Soon p/91110003 e/duesoon@example.com a/3 Test Road f/24-10-2026`

   1. Test case: `due`<br>
      Expected: `Due Past` then `Due Today` are shown, plus any other contact due by today. `Due Soon` is not shown.
      The result shows `N follow-ups due by 21-10-2026.` The `Due Past` card shows its date in red with `(overdue)`.

   1. Test case: `due 3`<br>
      Expected: `Due Soon` is now included, after the other two.

   1. Test case: `due` followed by `done 1`<br>
      Expected: The earliest follow-up in the sorted list is completed.

   1. Other incorrect commands to try: `due -1`, `due 366`, `due abc`, `due 7 days`<br>
      Expected: No change to the list. Error: `Number of days must be a whole number from 0 to 365, e.g. due 7.`

### Saving data

1. Dealing with a missing data file

   1. Close the app. Delete `data/addressbook.json` from the folder you ran the app from.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with the sample contacts. The data file is created again after the next command that runs without an error, such as `list`.

1. Dealing with a corrupted data file

   1. Close the app. Open `data/addressbook.json` and change one contact's `"status"` value to `"lead"`.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with an empty contact list, because the file could not be read. A copy of the invalid file is saved as `data/addressbook.json.bak`. Restoring the original value and relaunching brings the contacts back.

   1. Repeat with one contact's `"phone"` changed to 31 or more digits.<br>
      Expected: The same as above. The app still opens.

1. Dealing with a data file containing JSON `null`

   1. Close the app. Replace the entire contents of `data/addressbook.json` with `null`.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with an empty contact list. Both `data/addressbook.json` and its new `.bak` copy contain exactly `null`; sample contacts do not appear.

1. Dealing with a failed backup

   1. Close the app. Put invalid JSON in `data/addressbook.json`. If `data/addressbook.json.bak` exists, move it somewhere safe, then create a non-empty folder with that name.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: Startup stops with an error naming the data and backup paths. The original `data/addressbook.json` remains unchanged.

   1. Remove the blocking folder and relaunch.<br>
      Expected: The invalid data is backed up and the app starts with an empty contact list.

1. Dealing with an older data file

   1. Close the app. Remove the `"status"` and `"followUp"` fields from one contact in `data/addressbook.json`.

   1. Relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: The contact loads with status `PROSPECT` and no follow-up. Nothing else is lost.
